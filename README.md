my first
My name is Mike Luellen and mpg is my game. I am on a new kick, I am trying to get the most miles per gallon out of my car. I am keeping my foot out of the accelerator. Starting off easy. Keeping my speed closer to the limit. Coasting more. It has been interesting so far. It takes longer to get anywhere, but not too much longer. I am usually a considerate but aggresive driver. I cannot be aggresive and thrifty at the same time. However, I am getting more mpg than the car's rating.
